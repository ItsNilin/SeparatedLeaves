This mod makes Leaves only stick to their own Log type. This means that, for instance, after you chop down an Oak Tree standing next to a Birch Tree, all Oak Leaves will despawn even though they were connected to the Birch Tree.

This is also useful when, for example, decorating a tree farm, because you can use any other Log type in your build without worrying about leaves sticking to your walls.

### The mod is data-driven!

This means that you can add compatibility for any mod yourself, through data packs.
