# Separated Leaves Changelog

## 2.5.0
- Updated to 1.21 & NeoForge
- The mod is now disabled in unknown modded biomes by default. This is to make sure no leaves get destroyed in biome mods without current support.
- Removed the `allow_mismatched_leaves` biome tag.
- Every namespace now needs a `biomes.json` file to enable the mod in their biomes.
  - For more info, see the [documentation](https://docs.teamdiopside.nl/separated-leaves/biomes-and-structures)!
